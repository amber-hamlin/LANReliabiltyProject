# LANReliabiltyProject

The LAN reliability project used MATLAB to simulate 5 different network link configurations: 
a single link, two series link, two parallel link, a compound network link, and a custom compound network link. 
For each configuration, the different plots were made by simulating an application message being sent with a specific number
of packets the goal was to find the average number of transmissions needed to send the application message for all possible 
values of p, the probability of failure. The results are displayed visually on plots.
